## 🎄 What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an annual programming challenge created by Eric Wastl. Each
December, from December 1st to December 25th (12th starting 2025), a new **programming puzzle** is
released **daily**. These challenges are designed to help programmers improve
their skills, explore new programming concepts, and have fun while coding.
